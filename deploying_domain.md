🔐 Configuring WebSockets for HTTPS (Secure Communication)

By default, WebSockets use ws://, which isn’t secure. For production, you need to upgrade it to wss:// (WebSocket Secure) to ensure encrypted communication.

1. Modify Flask Backend for Secure WebSockets

Update your Flask app.py to use SSL certificates for WebSockets.
	1.	Generate SSL Certificate (Self-Signed for Testing)
Run the following command to generate a certificate and key:

openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout cert.key -out cert.pem

	2.	Update Flask App to Use SSL
Modify the app.py Flask server to load SSL.

if __name__ == '__main__':
    socketio.run(app, host='0.0.0.0', port=10000, certfile='cert.pem', keyfile='cert.key')

	3.	Commit and Push Changes

git add app.py cert.pem cert.key
git commit -m "Add SSL for secure WebSockets"
git push

2. Update Frontend to Use Secure WebSockets

Modify your React frontend (App.js) to connect via wss:// instead of ws://.

src/App.js

const socket = io('wss://job-backend.onrender.com', {
    transports: ['websocket'],
    secure: true
});

3. Configure Render for SSL (Optional)

If you don’t want to use self-signed certificates, Render provides automatic HTTPS:
	1.	Go to your Render service.
	2.	Under Settings > Custom Domains, enable Force HTTPS.
	3.	Render automatically generates SSL certificates.

🌐 Domain Linking for a Professional Look

1. Connect Custom Domain to Vercel (Frontend)

	1.	Go to Vercel and open your frontend project.
	2.	Click on Settings > Domains.
	3.	Add your custom domain (e.g., www.yourjobapp.com).
	4.	Vercel will guide you to update your domain DNS:
	•	Add A Record pointing to Vercel’s IP.
	•	Add CNAME for www to cname.vercel-dns.com.

2. Connect Custom Domain to Render (Backend)

	1.	Go to Render and open your backend project.
	2.	Click Settings > Custom Domains.
	3.	Add your domain (e.g., api.yourjobapp.com).
	4.	Update your DNS:
	•	A Record pointing to Render’s IP.
	•	CNAME for subdomains (e.g., api).
	5.	Render will issue an SSL certificate automatically.

3. Test the Domain

	•	Visit www.yourjobapp.com (Vercel Frontend).
	•	Ensure API calls are routed to api.yourjobapp.com (Render Backend).
	•	Confirm WebSocket connections are secure by checking wss://api.yourjobapp.com.

✅ Next Steps

	•	Add CI/CD Pipeline for automated deployment.
	•	Monitor WebSocket Traffic using tools like Socket.IO Admin.
	•	Enable Logging for tracking WebSocket events.
