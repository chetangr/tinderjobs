ðŸš€ Setting Up CI/CD for Automated Deployment (Frontend + Backend)

CI/CD ensures automatic deployment whenever code is pushed to GitHub. Letâ€™s configure pipelines for both the Flask backend (on Render) and React frontend (on Vercel).

ðŸ”§ CI/CD for Flask (Backend on Render)

1. Setup GitHub Actions for Flask

In your backend/ directory, create a .github/workflows/deploy.yml file.

backend/.github/workflows/deploy.yml

name: Deploy Flask App to Render

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Deploy only when pushing to main branch

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set Up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v3
        with:
          python-version: 3.10

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: |
          cd backend
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Deploy to Render
        env:
          RENDER_SERVICE_ID: ${{ secrets.RENDER_SERVICE_ID }}
          RENDER_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.RENDER_API_KEY }}
        run: |
          curl -X POST \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer $RENDER_API_KEY" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            "https://api.render.com/v1/services/$RENDER_SERVICE_ID/deploys"

2. Get Render API Key

	1.	Go to Render > API Keys and generate a new key.
	2.	Copy the key and add it as a GitHub secret:
	â€¢	In your GitHub repo, go to Settings > Secrets > Actions.
	â€¢	Add two secrets:
	â€¢	RENDER_API_KEY â€“ Paste the Render API Key.
	â€¢	RENDER_SERVICE_ID â€“ Get this from Render by visiting Service > Settings > Service ID.

ðŸ”§ CI/CD for React (Frontend on Vercel)

1. Configure Vercel for Automatic Deployment

	â€¢	Vercel already sets up CI/CD by default when linked to GitHub.
	â€¢	Any push to the main branch will trigger an automatic build and deploy.

2. GitHub Action for Vercel (Optional)

If you want to handle deployment via GitHub Actions manually:

frontend/.github/workflows/deploy.yml

name: Deploy React to Vercel

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Deploy to Vercel
        run: |
          npm install -g vercel
          cd frontend
          vercel --token ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }} --prod

3. Get Vercel Token

	1.	Go to Vercel > Account > Settings > Tokens.
	2.	Generate a new token and add it to GitHub secrets as VERCEL_TOKEN.

ðŸ“¡ Monitoring WebSockets and API (Real-time Logs)

1. Monitor Flask (Render)

	â€¢	In Render, go to Logs to monitor real-time Flask logs.
	â€¢	WebSocket connections will appear as:

WebSocket connection established
New message received

2. Monitor WebSockets (Frontend React)

	1.	Use Socket.IO Admin UI to visualize WebSocket traffic.
	2.	Install the admin UI:

npm install socket.io-admin-ui

	3.	Add admin UI to your backend Flask app.py:

from socketio_admin import create_admin_ui
create_admin_ui(app, socketio, '/admin')

	4.	Visit https://job-backend.onrender.com/admin to see active WebSocket connections.

ðŸŽ¯ Testing the CI/CD Pipeline

	1.	Push changes to the main branch.
	2.	Verify that the GitHub Action triggers deployments to Render and Vercel.
	3.	Check the deployment logs for success.
	4.	Visit the appâ€™s domain to confirm the deployment.

ðŸ“… Next Steps

	â€¢	Add Unit Tests: Automate testing as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
	â€¢	Performance Monitoring: Integrate Sentry or Datadog to monitor performance.
	â€¢	Kubernetes: Scale the app using Kubernetes on Render.
