Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide to deploy your frontend (React) on Vercel and the backend (Flask) on Render.

üöÄ Deploy Flask Backend on Render

Render is a great choice for deploying Flask apps, and it supports WebSockets natively.

1. Setup Render Account

	‚Ä¢	Go to https://render.com and create an account.
	‚Ä¢	In the dashboard, click New Web Service.

2. Prepare Backend for Deployment

	1.	Create requirements.txt in your backend/ folder.

flask
flask-cors
flask-socketio
duckdb
google-api-python-client
google-auth
google-auth-oauthlib
google-auth-httplib2
eventlet

	2.	Add start.sh to run the Flask app.

#!/bin/bash
python app.py

	3.	Modify app.py for Production
Update the last part of your app.py to handle production settings.

if __name__ == '__main__':
    socketio.run(app, host='0.0.0.0', port=10000)

3. Deploy to Render

	1.	In the Render dashboard, select New Web Service.
	2.	Connect your GitHub/GitLab repository (or directly upload your code).
	3.	Choose backend/ as the project root.
	4.	Fill in the service details:
	‚Ä¢	Environment: Python 3.x
	‚Ä¢	Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt
	‚Ä¢	Start Command: bash start.sh
	‚Ä¢	Port: 10000 (same as Flask app)
	5.	Click Deploy.
	6.	After deployment, copy the Render URL (e.g., https://job-backend.onrender.com).

üöÄ Deploy React Frontend on Vercel

Vercel is quick and easy for React deployments.

1. Setup Vercel Account

	‚Ä¢	Go to https://vercel.com and create an account.
	‚Ä¢	Click New Project and import your GitHub project.

2. Prepare Frontend for Deployment

	1.	Add Proxy to Frontend
In frontend/package.json, add a proxy to point to the backend URL (from Render).

"proxy": "https://job-backend.onrender.com"

	2.	Build the Frontend

npm run build

	3.	Create vercel.json
Add this to your frontend/ root.

{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/api/(.*)",
      "destination": "https://job-backend.onrender.com/api/$1"
    }
  ]
}

3. Deploy to Vercel

	1.	In the Vercel dashboard, import your project.
	2.	Select the frontend/ folder.
	3.	Click Deploy.
	4.	After deployment, copy the Vercel URL (e.g., https://job-frontend.vercel.app).

üîÑ Testing the App

	1.	Visit the Vercel URL (React frontend).
	2.	Test the swiping functionality and apply for jobs.
	3.	Check Google Calendar for interview scheduling events.
	4.	Confirm real-time updates via WebSockets (Render backend).

üåê Domain Setup (Optional)

	‚Ä¢	You can connect a custom domain to Vercel for the frontend.
	‚Ä¢	For the backend, use Render‚Äôs free domain or link a custom domain.
